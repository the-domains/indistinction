Today's article inspired by: https://goo.gl/3eTrHl

"Are you dead?"

"Yes, I'm dead."

"But how can you say that?  If you were dead, you would not speak."

"But I am dead.  I have no brain, no viscera...  All that's left is skin and bones, which are rotting before me and already stink."

"But you are most certainly not dead!!!  If you are dead, then who is this before me?"

"You are dead, too."

"I am not dead!"

"Yes, you are.  I am dead, and you are dead.  And this horrible place is our prison."

(Pinches patient.)

"I do not exist."

"You do exist.  I just pinched you."

"I do not exist.  I used to exist, but I exist no longer."

"But here you are."

"No, I am not."

And so goes the conversation between our Cotard's patient and their loved one.  Some Cotard's patients simply deny that they exist; others claim that they are dead, such as ours above.  Against all evidence to the contrary,  she believes that she is dead.  In some cases, patients even contend that their bodies are decomposing and already stink.

Imagine for a moment that you are the Cotard's patient, and believed that you were dead.  Can you imagine the indignation of your loved one if you made this claim to them?  That you are dead, even as you speak?  Can you hear the frustration build as what was taken for a joke slowly turns to their realization that you have lost touch with reality?

With such a clear case of delusion, it's difficult to imagine that we are faced with this kind of indignation every day.  And yet we are.

Hi.  I'm Tonya, and this is the inaugural edition of InDistinction; a blog meant to tease out distinctions from popular media to help spark thought and conversation to satisfy your intellectual curiosity.

What sort of distinctions?  Well let's dive into this first case, as brought to my attention through a trending article from the Washington Post exploring the topic of Cotard's Syndrome.

Distinction One:  The difference between mind and body, mental and neurological, and its relationship to freewill.  

What struck me when reading this article is the lack of conversation around the distinction between neurological and mental disorder.  In the article they explain where researchers believe a similar disorder is taking place - in two places in the brain.  It is almost accepted without question that the mental or mind arises from the body, also known as the brain.  

But this is where I would draw a distinction, or at least ask the question: Is there a difference between the body and the mind?  

Let's assume that Cotard's is a mental (mind) phenomenon, and not a neurological (brain) phenomenon.  What then is the difference between a mental and a neurological explanation of disorder?  For our purposes here, and inspired by Graham, a mental disorder does not have a differentiable physical or material cause, whereas a neurological disorder does.  I believe this matters in this case because the common thread among Cotard's patients seems to be depression, which in spite of physical explanations, can arguably be called a mental disorder (and by arguably, I mean see Graham).  Now, just because we can't determine a physical cause does not mean there isn't one, but we'll play along here to find other interesting questions.

Ultimately for me, the interesting thing about these questions is when we apply our answers to self.  What is me?  Is it my body?  Is it my mind?  If I am my body, and my body is subject to physical laws, is my mind even relevant?  Where is my choice?  Where is my autonomy?  If I am my mind, and not my body, then what is the relationship between my mind and my body?

As we are still getting to know one another, it is important to note here, that unlike Graham, I am a dualist (Cartesian at that), which means I believe that the mind is quite distinct from the body; but these distinctions are not being explored here to espouse my beliefs.  Rather, when I do have a definite stance on a particular subject, it is prudent to declare it so you, my reader, can hold me responsible for the assumptions made on my belief's behalf in any of my argumentation.

Back to the distinctions...

Distinction Two: The difference between logical and emotional, and what they have to do with belief, and belief to free will.

So much of what we claim in any conversation is based on our individual experience and observation of the world (either internally or externally) that informs our emotions and our beliefs.  And thus another distinction arises, between that of logic and that of emotion, and any relation between.  Am I to believe only what I can logically conclude?  If I hold logic above emotion, do I gain something or do I lose something or both?  

And here is our link back to our Cotard's patient who is still persistently claiming she is dead.  Common to Cotard's patients is the lack of affect or emotion in response to common emotional stimuli.  Because of this, everything seems foreign and unreal to them.  

At the loss of her capacity for emotional response to her surroundings, it would seem the logical conclusion available to her was that she was dead and no longer existed (it seems this way because that is precisely what she concluded).  Many Cotard's patients are suicidal, which begs a further question, what is it for which we live?  If these patients have less or no emotional connection to their lives where they expect to have emotional connection and response, how does that translate to a desire to kill oneself?  Never mind the notion of killing oneself when one already believes themselves to be dead.

Distinction Three: The difference between treating beliefs as voluntary or involuntary, and the trending indignation.

Perhaps our logic is meant to reconcile our emotions with our beliefs, rather than overriding emotions and driving beliefs.  Let's pretend this is the case, and suddenly the claim "I am dead," can be a truthful expression of a conclusion drawn internally from information available to our Cotard's patient.  Anyone who cares to utter anything different from the patient's self-diagnosis of being dead is irrelevant, as demonstrated by the persisting belief until self-resolution, days, weeks, months or even years later.  Graham in particular seems indignant at this particular response; negating the possibility of reason behind the conclusion of the patient.  And this lends itself to the final distinction I wish to make; voluntary versus involuntary belief.

It is common to hear one claim an incompetence at choosing their own beliefs.  "Oh, I can't believe that."  Or, "I wish I could believe that."  And yet, when confronted with someone else's beliefs, it is also common to hear someone insist that the other person should change their beliefs.  "You should see it this way," or, "You can't possibly believe that."  (I did not notice this myself; but I forget to whom it is owed as an attribution.)

So, when considering the Cotard's patient who claims "I am dead," and the response is, "You can't possibly believe that," the question becomes is it reasonable to hold people accountable for their beliefs if you do not feel responsible for your own?  Is it kind?  Is it just?  Is it respectful?

These questions may seem insignificant when such an egregious example of belief is set before us; but might I suggest to you these are real questions we encounter every day.  Whenever there is a disagreement, however minor, there is at least a perceived clash in beliefs.  And to the extent you might conclude that you are or are not in control over your beliefs, or that others are or are not in control of theirs, perhaps we are all Cotard's patients.

And thus concludes this first edition of InDistinction.

This dialogue is an imagined conversation between a Cotard's patient and a loved one.  The Cotard's patient presumably suffers from a delusion of being dead or non-existent.  While being very much alive, they continue to insist they are not alive, and some, that they have died.  Some also claim that their bodies are decomposing and disappearing into nothingness.

****

They have some further similarities, these patients.  They no longer feel emotions about their environments and lives, as determined by the lack of affect they demonstrate when confronted.

****

I find this particular phenomenon fascinating for all the questions it raises, namely, the distinctions.

****

For the sake of argument, let's assume that Cotard's Syndrome is a mental disorder, not a neurological disorder, which brings us to the first distinction.  What is the difference between a mental disorder and a neurological disorder?  For our purposes here, and inspired by 

Graham

, a neurological disorder has a physical or material cause such as traumatic brain injury, while the mental disorder does not appear to have a differentiable physical or material cause.  So we will assume that there is no physical or material cause to the Cotard's patient's symptoms.  Of course, just because we can't find a physical or material cause, does not mean there is no such physical or material cause; but we'll play along here to draw out further distinctions.

**[][0]**

Distinction One: The difference between mental and neurological disorder.  Is there a difference?

****

Now, assuming that there is a distinction between mental and neurological disorder, what makes Cotard's a mental disorder?  Well, aside from the common diagnosis of depression, the patients do not suffer similar in injury or physical disease so far as we can tell, and depression itself is arguably a mental disorder, in spite of the physical theory aimed to explain it.  So what then is the importance of describing a set of symptoms as being a mental disorder?  I would say that it has to do with the difference between body and mind, and what that means for self.  

****

It is important to note here, that unlike Graham, I am a dualist (Cartesian at that), and do subscribe to a mind that is quite distinct from the body; but these distinctions are not being explored here to espouse my beliefs.  Rather, when I do have a definite stance on a particular subject, it is prudent to declare it so you, my reader, can hold me responsible for the assumptions made on my belief's behalf in any of my argumentation.

****

Distinction Two: The difference between body and mind, and how or if that relates to self.

****

So much of what we claim in any conversation is based on our individual experience and observation of the world (either internally or externally) that informs our emotions and our beliefs.  And thus another distinction arises, between that of logic and that of emotion, and any relation between.  Am I to believe only what I can logically conclude?

If these patients have less or no emotional connection to their lives where they expect to have emotional connection and response, how does that translate to a desire to kill oneself?  Never mind the notion of killing oneself when one already believes themselves to be dead.

****

Why care about a difference between the body (brain) and the mind?  And herein lies the crux of interest in exploring these topics.  If we answer that the mind is the brain or arises from the brain, what is left that belongs to each of us individually, and not the world at large?  If we answer that the mind is distinct from the brain, then we must answer whether it can affect or change matter in a physical world, or whether there is such thing as a physical world.  One answer seems to presume an external reality bearing down on our experience, the other neither predicts nor precludes an external reality.  And in some following arguments, an external physical reality having its way with the physical reality of our minds leaves us at the whim of external forces, which to many is incompatible with the notion of self and freewill.

****

Distinction Three: The difference between determinism and freewill as informed by the difference between body and mind.

So much of what we claim in any conversation is based on our individual experience and observation of the world (either internally or externally) that informs our emotions and our beliefs.  And thus another distinction arises, between that of logic and that of emotion, and any relation between.  Am I to believe only what I can logically conclude?
